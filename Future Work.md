# Future Work & Roadmap

PWA App 
  - The inbox is showing resolved conversations
  - scrolling in a conversation causes a refresh in the inbox
  - we can't reply to conversations
  - the messages don't show like they should, they have the html code instead, we had this issue in the desktop version a while ago
  - in the analytics section the visitors, new customers and conversion isn't working along with all the compare %
  - the live visiors page needs us to be able to click a visitor and see the full visitor log for that visitor.


We need a way to update the whole overseek system in docker without taking it down and redeploying it, is this possible whilst being secure?
