# Debug Status: Docker Build Failure - RESOLVED ✅

## Current Phase: Completed (Attempt 1)
## Resolution: Prisma 7 + npm workspaces + Node.js 22
## Resolution: npm workspaces context fix

---

## Root Cause

The project uses **npm workspaces** (defined in root `package.json`). When Docker built only `./server`:
1. Docker copied only `server/package.json` (no root workspace context)
2. `npm install` couldn't resolve workspace dependencies properly
3. Packages like `zod`, `otplib`, `qrcode` weren't installed
4. TypeScript build failed with "Cannot find module" errors

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. OrderTaggingService.ts Type Cast
- Changed `as TagMapping[]` → `as unknown as TagMapping[]`
- Required because Prisma's `JsonValue` type doesn't overlap with custom interfaces

### 2. docker-compose.yml
- Changed API build context from `./server` to `.` (root)
- Added explicit `dockerfile: server/Dockerfile`

### 3. server/Dockerfile (Complete Rewrite)
- Now copies root `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first
- Uses `npm install --workspace=server` to install dependencies properly
- Copies server source after install
- Sets `WORKDIR /app/server` for build/runtime

### 4. Root .dockerignore
- Created to exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, `.env`, etc.
- Optimizes Docker build context size

## Verification

Docker build completed successfully:
- 485 packages installed correctly
- Prisma client generated
- TypeScript compilation passed
- Image tagged as `overseekv2-api:latest`
